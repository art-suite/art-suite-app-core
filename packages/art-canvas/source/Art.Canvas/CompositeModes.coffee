    NEW - October 2018
    The HTMLCanvas composite mode naming just isn't intutive to me

    Goals:
    - cover the core 8 "alpha" composite modes
    - support all the offical named modes
    - don't be confusing with the offical named modes
    - use "source" and "target" - target is just so much more format-friendly; plus it's shorter

    Scheme:
      [color-operation][alpha-operation]

      color-operations:
        sourceTop:      colorBlend source, target
        targetTop:      colorBlend target, source

      alpha-operation:
        union:          pixel-set-union:                        1 - (1 - a.alpha) * (1 - b.alpha)
        intersection:   pixel-set-intersection:                 target.alpha * source.alpha
        inTarget:       use-target-pixel-set:                   target.alpha
        inSource:       use-source-pixel-set:                   source.alpha
        withoutSource:  pixel-set-subtraction(target - source): target.alpha * (1 - source.alpha)
        withoutTarget:  pixel-set-subtraction(source - target): source.alpha * (1 - target.alpha)

    Def'n:
      alphaUnion: (a, b)                  -> 1 - (1 - a.alpha) * (1 - b.alpha)
      colorBlend: (topPixel, bottomPixel) -> rgb(topPixel) * alpha.alpha + rgb(bottomPixel) * (1 - alpha.alpha)

      blend: (topPixel, bottomPixel) ->
        rgb:    colorBlend topPixel, bottomPixel
        alpha:  alphaUnion topPixel, bottomPixel

    sourceTopUnion:         "source-over"       # alpha: alphaUnion,            color: colorBlend source, target
    sourceTopInTarget:      "source-atop"       # alpha: target,                color: colorBlend source, target
    sourceTopIntersection:  "source-in"         # alpha: target * source,       color: source
    sourceWithoutTarget:    "source-out"        # alpha: source * (1 - target), color: source
    targetTopUnion:         "destination-over"  # alpha: alphaUnion,            color: colorBlend target, source
    targetTopInSource:      "destination-atop"  # alpha: source,                color: colorBlend target, source
    targetTopIntersection:  "destination-in"    # alpha: target * source,       color: target
    targetWithoutSource:    "destination-out"   # alpha: target * (1 - source), color: target
    add:                    "lighter"           # lighter:  Where both shapes overlap the color is determined by adding color values.
    max:                    "lighten"           # ligthen:  Retains the lightest pixels of both layers.
    min:                    "darken"            # darken:   Retains the darkest pixels of both layers.
    replace:                "copy"

    # preferred aliases

    sourceTop:              "source-over"
