  INPUT: zero or more strings or arrays of strings
    - arbitrary nesting of arrays is OK
    - nulls are OK, they are ignored
  OUTPUT: null

  NOTE: @aliases can be called multiple times.

  example:
    class Post extends FluxModel
      @aliases "chapterPost"

  purpose:
    - declare alternative names to access this model.
    - allows you to use the shortest form of FluxComponent subscriptions for each alias:
        @subscriptions "chapterPost"
      in addition to the model's class name:
        @subscriptions "post"

  ###
  load the requested data for the given key and update the fluxStore

  required:
    Should ALWAYS call fluxStore.update immediately OR once the data is available.
    Clients will assume that a call to "load" forces a reload of the data in the fluxStore.

  optional:
    If the data is immediately available, you can return the fluxRecord instead of "null"
    If load was called because of a new Component being mounted and its subscriptions initialized,
      returning the fluxRecord immediately will guarantee the Component has valid data for its
      first render.

  Note:
    Typically called automatically by the fluxStore when a Component subscribes to
    data from this model with the given key.

  The simplest possible load function:
    load: (key) -> @updateFluxStore key, {}

  The "load" function below is:
    Simplest "load" with immediate fluxRecord return.
    Immediate return means:
     - fluxStore.subscribe() will return the fluxRecord returned from this "load"
     - FluxComponent subscriptions will update state in time for the inital render.

  inputs:
    key: string

  side effects:
    expected to call fluxStore.update @_name, key, fluxRecord
      - when fluxRecord.status is no longer pending
      - optionally as progress is made loading the fluxRecord.data

  returns: null OR fluxRecord if the value is immediately available
    NOTE: load can return null or fluxRecord as it chooses. The client shouldn't
      rely on the fact that it returned a fluxRecord with a set of inputs, it might not
      the next time.

  Optionally, you can implement one of two altenative load functions with Promise support:

    loadData:       (key) ->
                      promise.then (data) ->
                        if data is null or undefined, status will be set to missing
                        otherwise, status will be success
                      promise.catch (a validStatus or error info, status becomes failure) ->
    loadFluxRecord: (key) -> promise.then (fluxRecord) ->

    @load will take care of updating FluxStore.

  ###
  load: (key) ->
    # ensure fluxStore is updated in case this is not beind called from the fluxStore itself
    # returns {status: missing} since updateFluxStore returns the last argument,
    #   this makes the results immediately available to subscribers.

    if @loadData || @loadFluxRecord
      @loadPromise key
      null
    else
      @updateFluxStore key, status: missing

  ###
  NOTE: @loadData or @loadFluxRecord should be implemented.
  @loadPromise is an alternative to @load

  Unlike @load, @loadPromise returns a promise that resolves when the load is done.

  The down-side is @loadPromise cannot immediately update the flux-store. If you have
  a model which stores its data locally, like ApplicationState, then override @load
  for immediate fluxStore updates.

  However, if your model always has to get the data asynchronously, override @loadData
  or @loadFluxRecord and use @loadPromise anytime you need to manually trigger a load.

  EFFECTS:
  - Triggers loadData or loadFluxRecord.
  - Puts the results in the fluxStore.
  - Elegently reduces multiple in-flight requests with the same key to one Promise.
    @loadData or @loadFluxRecord will only be invoked once per key while their
    returned promises are unresolved.
    NOTE: the block actually extends all the way through to the fluxStore being updated.
    That means you can immediately call @fluxStoreGet and get the latest data - when
    the promise resolves.

  OUT: promise.then (fluxRecord) ->
    fluxRecord: the latest, just-loaded data
    ERRORS: errors are encoded into the fluxRecord. The promise should always resolve.
  ###
  loadPromise: (key) ->
    if p = @_activeLoadingRequests[key]
      log "saved 1 reload due to activeLoadingRequests! (model: #{@name}, key: #{key})"
      return p

    p = if @loadData
      Promise.then    => @loadData key
      .then (data)    => @updateFluxStore key, if data? then status: success, data: data else status: missing
      .catch (error)  =>
        if validStatus error
          @updateFluxStore key, status: error
        else
          @updateFluxStore key, status: failure, error: error
    else if @loadFluxRecord
      @loadFluxRecord key
      .then (fluxRecord) => @updateFluxStore key, fluxRecord
      .catch (error)     => @updateFluxStore key, status: failure, error: error
    else
      Promise.resolve @updateFluxStore key, status: missing

    @_activeLoadingRequests[key] = p
    .then (result) => @onNextReady(); result
    .then (result) => @_activeLoadingRequests[key] = null; result

  # load is not required to updateFluxStore
  # reload guarantees fluxStore is updated
  # override reload if your load does not always updateFluxStore (eventually)
  reload: (key) ->
    @load key
