# ArtSuite: [ZEN](http://www.essenceandartifact.com/2016/02/yagni-and-building-in-house-frameworks.html) Apps for Web and Mobile

If your website has a login, has any dynamically generated web pages, or otherwise has a non-trivial amount of code, you are writing an app, not a collection of documents. HTML is an [flying-submarine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_submarine). I.e, it's trying to do two things at the same time which are fundamentally different: be a document format and an app framework. It is impossible to do both those things well at the same time.

Enter Art.Suite, a modern, clean, canvas and JavaScript-based framework for writing web-apps without HTML. Not only can you write full-featured, responsive web-apps with ease, you can also deploy high quality hybrid Android and iOS apps with 90%+ code reuse.

### What is the Art.Suite?

A collection of tools with two main goals:

1. One platform for Cloud-Enabled Apps across Web, Mobile-Web and 'native' Apps.
2. Maximize developer productivity.

Sub goals include:

* designer-oriented
* minimize code (measured in tokens)
* maximum extensibility at all levels
* built on ubiquitous standards (Javascript and HTMLCanvas)
